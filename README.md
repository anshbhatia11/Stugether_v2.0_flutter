# Stugether v2.0

### Project Description
Currently, several platform exists to manage and organize various activities at an Intra University level. The problem with similar applications is that one application provides one or limited accessibility which in the end affects the User Experience and further creates problem for both students and management. Even if any application overcomes this challenge, it fails to achieve the similar goals on an Inter University Level. Hence, either student miss out on multiple opportunities throughout their college life or they have to keep track of their college activities on more than one application making it problematic

In order to handle the situation, we aim to build or recreate “STUGETHER”. Stugether aims at building a collaborative platform for universities that can help them in better communication, organization and planning. In addition to this, it aims to provide better usability and more flexibility to its user. Stugether aims at building a platform that would prove to be an assistance to students at both Inter and Intra University Level.

### Core Features
